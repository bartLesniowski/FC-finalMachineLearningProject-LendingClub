My final machine learning project for Future Collars Data Science bootcamp.

# About Lending Club
Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending company that connects borrowers with investors through an online platform. It serves people who need personal loans ranging from $ 1,000 to $ 40,000. Borrowers receive the full amount of the loan granted, minus the initial fee that is paid to the company. Investors buy promissory notes backed by personal loans and pay the Lending Club a service fee. The Lending Club company provides data on all loans granted via its platform during specified periods. 

# About project
The task was to use LC data from period 2007 - 2011 to build predictive model of default client with Charge Off and Fully Paid loan statuses. There were 4 main stages to be executed before building final model:
1. Data Processing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Modeling with additional stages:
  - Clustering with 3 different clusters
  - Model Training with 5 different models
  - PCA decomposition (just for sake of curiosity I did KMeans clustering for PCA decomposition)
  - Model Training with 5 different models
  - Building Final Model

Final Model had to have AUC ROC >=80%. 
In addition, I was tasked with using statistical tests for some of my hypotheses.
